ðŸ¦Š Hey, I'm fox. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a college student studying mechanical engineering. I'm also an HVAC Engineering Intern for John Wood Group PLC. 
- ðŸŒ¿ I love to be creative, and to try and make cool stuff. 
- ðŸŒ³ More than that, I love to learn new things. And I've still got a lot of learning to do. <p><br>
So this README.md is somewhat of a checklist for me to learn how to use more digital tools- so i can make cooler stuff.

  Autodesk AutoCAD
  Autodesk Inventor
  PTC Creo

  GNU Octave
